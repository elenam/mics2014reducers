% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2003} will cause 2003 to appear in the copyright line.

\section*{\centering Abstract}
In modern processing environments, parallelism is becoming an increasingly important tool in making gains in software performance. Despite the importance of parallelism, it is often poorly supported, or awkward to use effectively. The most common approach to concurrency is the mutable state model, where threads can attempt to read or write the value of a shared resource. This approach, while it may be more efficient, can cause problems such as deadlocking - a state where two threads are both waiting for a resource that the other task holds. In immutable state systems, this is prevented by having the thread create an instance of the resource as soon as it is able to access the resource.


Clojure is a Lisp dialect designed for concurrency and portability by Rich Hickey, with the first release in late 2007. Clojure runs on the Java virtual machine, and features immutable data structures along with other tools to make concurrent development easier. Immutable data structures do not present problems stemming from sharing the same memory. Clojure has proven to provide high efficiency of parallel processing. In 2012 clojure.core.reducers was added to the language: a novel library that contains a set of high level functions for an even more convenient and efficient parallel processing of data collections. Clojure originally had an earlier version of this functionality in pmap, a parallel version of map, a built in function that traverses Clojure collections. Clojure includes many utilities that are implemented using significantly different methods. Reducers are based on the Java Fork/Join framework, while pmap uses the Java Futures library.


In this study, we focus on testing the various methods of parallel processing in Clojure and explore the functionality of the reducers library. Timing the execution of computationally expensive and highly parallelizable data processing allows us to directly observe the differences between different methods of parallelism provided in Clojure. In order to time the execution we used a Clojure utility that allows access to the system clock. We created a function that records the system time, executes a given function, and then returns the elapsed time. The functions have been timed on two systems as of now; a system with two Intel Xeon four-core processors and another with a hyperthreaded Intel i7.


We have found that both \clocode{pmap} and reducers decrease the execution time by a factor of the number of cores, as expected. Reducers were found to provide a significant performance gain, in all situations, over \clocode{pmap}. We also studied the distribution of load across multiple cores, and the scaling of the execution time as data size increases. We present the results, analysis, and conclusions.

 \subsection{Execution Methodology}\label{sec:eMethods}
 Following the method shown above, we ran the tests on several different machines referred to as box1, box2, and box3.
 
\begin{itemize}
 \item 
 Box 1 has a Intel i7 (4700MQ) cpu, with 4 hyperthreaded cores, running Windows 7.
 \item
 Box 2 has a Intel i5 (650) cpu, with 4 cores, running Fedora 18.
 \item
 Box 3 has a xyz cpu, with q cores, running foo OS. Box 1 has a xzy cpu, with q cores, running foo OS.
 \end{itemize}

\subsection{Tests}\label{sec:tests}
\emcomment{Describe the tests. Joe, this should be your section for the most part, although Henry changed some of the outputs and added more cases}

\emcomment{Need to explain why we aren't using a filter here for primality testing examples: for consistency with pmap?}

\subsection{Results}\label{sec:results}
In this section we show the results of running our tests across the machines mentioned above;
\hfcomment{I'll be putting the carts \& tables here}


\subsection{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}
We have found that both \clocode{pmap} and reducers decrease the execution time by a factor of the number of cores, as expected. The Reducers library was found to provide a significant performance gain, in all situations, over \clocode{pmap}. The average gain was x\%, with a range from a\% to b\%.
